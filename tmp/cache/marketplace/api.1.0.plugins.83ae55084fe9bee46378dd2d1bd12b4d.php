BotTracker-Plugin for Piwik

for additional information go to http://dev.piwik.org/trac/ticket/2391

This plugin is still in BETA-status, but I have testet it for a while. It should be stable.

Before you install this plugin, some things you should be aware of:

- many webcrawler, spiders and bots don\'t load the images in a page and most of them don\'t execute JavaScript. So you cannot track them with Piwik if you don\'t use the PHP-API. The BotTracker can only track those, who were caught by Piwik itself.

- if you update form Piwik 1.x to Piwik 2.x sometimes the update-script (BotTracker\\Updates\\0.43.php) is not executed. In this case you get an error about a not existing column "extra_stats" when you open the config-page. Then you have to execute the following 2 statemnts on your Piwik-Database (e.g. with MyPHPAdmin):

```sql
ALTER TABLE `piwik_bot_db`
ADD `extra_stats` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `piwik_bot_db_stat`
(
 `botId` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `idsite` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `page` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 `visit_timestamp` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
 `useragent` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
		 
 PRIMARY KEY(`botId`)
)  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```

- the "extra Stats"-Feature is in "early developing". You can collect the data about the who, when and where, but there is currently no widget to display the data.


And last but not least:
I wrote BotTracker for my own needs but people ask me to make it public - so I put it online.
It\'s free to use and I will support it as long as I can spend the time. But I will *not* activate a donation button. If someone is paying money, I fell like I have to support him. 
I want to work on this plugin beacute I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.

I want to work on this plugin because I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.

## Installation / Update

See http://piwik.org/faq/plugins/#faq_21

for additional information go to http://dev.piwik.org/trac/ticket/2391

## Description

BotTracker ist a plugin to track the visits of bots, spiders and webcrawler, that hit yout page.

This plugin is still in BETA-status, but I have testet it for a while. It should be stable.

Before you install this plugin, here\'s something you should be aware of:
Many webcrawler, spiders and bots don\'t load the images in a page and most of them don\'t execute JavaScript. So you cannot track them with Piwik if you don\'t use the PHP-API. The BotTracker can only track those, who were caught by Piwik itself.



Additional info:
I wrote BotTracker for my own needs but people ask me to make it public - so I put it online.
It\'s free to use and I will support it as long as I can spend the time. But I will *not* activate a donation button. If someone is paying money, I feel like I have to support him. 
I want to work on this plugin because I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.

## Installation / Update

See http://piwik.org/faq/plugins/#faq_21

for additional information go to http://dev.piwik.org/trac/ticket/2391

If you update form Piwik 1.x to Piwik 2.x sometimes the update-script (BotTracker\\Updates\\0.43.php) is not executed. In this case you get an error about a not existing column "extra_stats" when you open the config-page. Then you have to execute the following 2 statemnts on your Piwik-Database (e.g. with MyPHPAdmin):

```sql
ALTER TABLE `piwik_bot_db`
ADD `extra_stats` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `piwik_bot_db_stat`
(
 `botId` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `idsite` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `page` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 `visit_timestamp` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
 `useragent` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
		 
 PRIMARY KEY(`botId`)
)  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```


The "extra Stats"-Feature is in "early developing". You can collect the data about the who, when and where, but there is currently no widget to display the data.

## Description

BotTracker ist a plugin to track the visits of bots, spiders and webcrawler, that hit yout page.

This plugin is still in BETA-status, but I have testet it for a while. It should be stable.

Before you install this plugin, here\'s something you should be aware of:
Many webcrawler, spiders and bots don\'t load the images in a page and most of them don\'t execute JavaScript. So you cannot track them with Piwik if you don\'t use the PHP-API. The BotTracker can only track those, who were caught by Piwik itself.



Additional info:
I wrote BotTracker for my own needs but people ask me to make it public - so I put it online.
It\'s free to use and I will support it as long as I can spend the time. But I will *not* activate a donation button. If someone is paying money, I feel like I have to support him. 
I want to work on this plugin because I want to and not because I have to. I hope you can unterstand that.

## Installation / Update

See http://piwik.org/faq/plugins/#faq_21

for additional information go to http://dev.piwik.org/trac/ticket/2391

If you update form Piwik 1.x to Piwik 2.x sometimes the update-script (BotTracker\\Updates\\0.43.php) is not executed. In this case you get an error about a not existing column "extra_stats" when you open the config-page. Then you have to execute the following 2 statemnts on your Piwik-Database (e.g. with MyPHPAdmin):

```sql
ALTER TABLE `piwik_bot_db`
ADD `extra_stats` BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `piwik_bot_db_stat`
(
 `botId` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `idsite` INTEGER(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
 `page` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
 `visit_timestamp` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
 `useragent` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
		 
 PRIMARY KEY(`botId`)
)  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```


The "extra Stats"-Feature is in "early developing". You can collect the data about the who, when and where, but there is currently no widget to display the data.

TreemapVisualization is a Piwik plugin that provides the treemap report visualization.

## Features

The treemap visualization will show rows of data tables as squares whose size correspond to the metric of the row. For example, if you\'re looking at visits, the row with the most visits will take up the most space. Just like the other graph visualizations, you can use it to easily see which rows have the largest values. The treemap differs from other graphs though, in that it shows much more rows.

The treemap visualization will also show you one thing that no other visualization included with Piwik does: the evolution of each row. You can hover over a treemap square to see how much the row changed from the last period. Each treemap square is also colored based on the evolution. A red square means the change is negative; a green square means the change is positive. The more green the bigger the change; the more red the smaller the change.

## Limitations

Currently there is one known limitation:

* Treemaps will not work with flattened tables. Currently, if a table is flattened, the treemap icon will be removed.

You can hover over a treemap square to see how much the row changed from the last period. Each treemap square is also colored based on the evolution. A red square means the change is negative; a green square means the change is positive. The more green the bigger the change; the more red the smaller the change.

## Limitations

Currently there is one known limitation:

* Treemaps will not work with flattened tables. Currently, if a table is flattened, the treemap icon will be removed.

TreemapVisualization is a Piwik plugin that provides the treemap report visualization. 

## Features

The treemap visualization will show rows of data tables as squares whose size correspond to the metric of the row. For example, if you\'re looking at visits, the row with the most visits will take up the most space. Just like the other graph visualizations, you can use it to easily see which rows have the largest values. The treemap differs from other graphs though, in that it shows much more rows.

The treemap visualization will also show you one thing that no other visualization included with Piwik does: the evolution of each row. You can hover over a treemap square to see how much the row changed from the last period. Each treemap square is also colored based on the evolution. A red square means the change is negative; a green square means the change is positive. The more green the bigger the change; the more red the smaller the change.

## Limitations

TreemapVisualization contains a new report visualization that will display your reports as tiles of different sizes and will show you how each metric has changed from the last period.

The treemap visualization displays rows of data as squares whose size corresponds to a metric in each row.

If you\'re looking at the visits in a report, the row with the most visits will take up the most space. Just like other graph visualizations, **you can use it to easily see which rows have the largest values**. The treemap differs from other graphs though, in that **it can show many more rows**.

#### Treemap colors for comparison with previous period

The treemap visualization will also show you one thing that no other visualization included with Piwik does: the **evolution** of each row. Hovering over a treemap square will show you how much the row changed from the last period (ie, the last day, week, etc.).

Each treemap square is colored based on the evolution value **so you can easily see how your data is changing**. A red square means the change is negative; a green square means the change is positive. The more green the bigger the change; the more red the smaller the change.

#### Known limitations

* Treemaps will not work with flattened tables. Currently, if a table is flattened, the treemap icon will be removed.
* Evolution values cannot be calculated for subtables (reports that are displayed when you click on a row or node).

<p>The treemap visualization will also show you one thing that no other visualization included with Piwik does: the <strong>evolution</strong> of each row. Hovering over a treemap square will show you how much the row changed from the last period (ie, the last day, week, etc.).</p>

<p>Each treemap square is colored based on the evolution value <strong>so you can easily see how your data is changing</strong>. A red square means the change is negative; a green square means the change is positive. The more green the bigger the change; the more red the smaller the change.</p>

<h4>Known limitations</h4>

<ul><li>Treemaps will not work with flattened tables. Currently, if a table is flattened, the treemap icon will be removed.</li>
<li>Evolution values cannot be calculated for subtables (reports that are displayed when you click on a row or node).</li>
</ul><h4>Feedback, bug report or requests</h4>

## Description

Plugin to create fake visits, websites, users and goals. This can be used by Piwik users or developers as an easy way to generate fake data to populate Piwik reports.

You can overwrite the log files that are used to generate fake visits in [plugins/VisitorGenerator/data](https://github.com/piwik/plugin-VisitorGenerator/blob/master/data) or add new logs to the `data` directory. All files ending with `*.log` will be replayed.

Plugin developers can provide their own log files by placing \'*.log\' files within a \'data\' directory of their plugin. This way plugin developers make sure there will be always useful test data.

### Usage 

#### UI
The plugin adds a new item to the Piwik admin UI visible only for users having Super User access under the section "Diagnostic". There you can select a site and for how many days in the past you want to generate new visits.

#### CLI
It also adds the following commands to the [Piwik CLI tool](http://developer.piwik.org/guides/piwik-on-the-command-line):

* Generate visits
* Generate goals
* Generate users
* Generate websites
* Generate annotation
* Shorten log file
* Anonymize log file

##### Examples
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-annotation --idsite 5` generate one annotation for the current day for site with id 5
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-goals --idsite 5` generates some predefined goals for site with id 5
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-users --limit 100`  generates 100 users
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-websites --limit 100` generates 100 websites
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-visits --idsite 5`  generates many visits for site with id 5 for today
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-visits --idsite 5 --days 2` generates many visits for site with id 5 for today and yesterday
* `./console visitorgenerator:anonymize-log /path/to/log` takes an Apache log file, anonymizes it and places it in a data directory so it will be replayed the next time "generate-visits" is executed
* `./console visitorgenerator:shorten-log /path/to/file.log > file.short.log` takes a large Apache log file and keeps only a small number of logs per day

## Changelog

- 1.0 Initial release
- 1.1 New features:
   * Added CLI commands
   * Added possibility to generate websites, users and goals
   * Replay all log files within the data directory
- 1.2 New features:
   * New log file added
   * Added possibility to shorten and anonymize log files
   * Added possibility to let plugins define their own log files
   * Added possibility to generate annotations
   * Replay only log entries having the same day of the month

## Description

Plugin to create fake visits, websites, users and goals. This can be used by Piwik users or developers as an easy way to generate fake data to populate Piwik reports.

You can overwrite the log files that are used to generate fake visits in [plugins/VisitorGenerator/data](https://github.com/piwik/plugin-VisitorGenerator/blob/master/data) or add new logs to the `data` directory. All files ending with `*.log` will be replayed.

Plugin developers can provide their own log files by placing \'*.log\' files within a \'data\' directory of their plugin. This way plugin developers make sure there will be always useful test data.

### Usage 

#### UI
The plugin adds a new item to the Piwik admin UI visible only for users having Super User access under the section "Diagnostic". There you can select a site and for how many days in the past you want to generate new visits.

#### CLI
It also adds the following commands to the [Piwik CLI tool](http://developer.piwik.org/guides/piwik-on-the-command-line):

* Generate visits
* Generate goals
* Generate users
* Generate websites
* Generate annotation
* Shorten log file
* Anonymize log file

##### Examples
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-annotation --idsite 5` generate one annotation for the current day for site with id 5
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-goals --idsite 5` generates some predefined goals for site with id 5
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-users --limit 100`  generates 100 users
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-websites --limit 100` generates 100 websites
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-visits --idsite 5`  generates many visits for site with id 5 for today
* `./console visitorgenerator:generate-visits --idsite 5 --days 2` generates many visits for site with id 5 for today and yesterday
* `./console visitorgenerator:anonymize-log /path/to/log` takes an Apache log file, anonymizes it and places it in a data directory so it will be replayed the next time "generate-visits" is executed
* `./console visitorgenerator:shorten-log /path/to/file.log > file.short.log` takes a large Apache log file and keeps only a small number of logs per day

## Changelog

- 1.0 Initial release
- 1.1 New features:
   * Added CLI commands
   * Added possibility to generate websites, users and goals
   * Replay all log files within the data directory
- 1.2 New features:
   * New log file added
   * Added possibility to shorten and anonymize log files
   * Added possibility to let plugins define their own log files
   * Added possibility to generate annotations
   * Replay only log entries having the same day of the month
- 1.2.1 New workaround:
   * When force_ssl is enabled, and visits are generated on `localhost`, force to use HTTP instead of HTTPS

2) Navigate to Settings->LDAP Users
3) If the LDAP Settings are correct you are now able to look up users from your directory

Note:
Everytime a user is trying to login to your Piwik, the password is first of all checked
against your LDAP, if fails the plugin will check against the database.

Note2:
Users may be modified and deleted via Settings->Users

Note3:
If you change the username in LDAP/AD it will not be updated to Piwik!

Note4:
When LDAP users are initially added on the \'Settings->LDAP Users\' page their password is not entered and stored in the database.
However, when they first login via the web interface their credentials will be saved correctly in a hashed format.
From that point on they can login via mobile apps and API in general.

## Description

**Piwik login that uses LDAP queries to authenticate users and offeres Kerberos SSO support.**

#### HowTo Create a new User from LDAP in Piwik:
* Login to Piwik backend as superuser
* Navigate to Manage->LDAP Users
* If the LDAP Settings are correct you are now able to look up users from your directory

#### Note:
* Everytime a user is trying to login to your Piwik, the password is first of all checked
against your LDAP, if fails the plugin will check against the database.

#### Note2:
* Users may be modified and deleted via Manage->Users

#### Note3:
* If you change the username in LDAP/AD it will not be updated to Piwik!

#### Note4:
* When LDAP users are initially added on the \'Manage->LDAP Users\' page their password is not entered and stored in the database.
However, when they first login via the web interface their credentials will be saved correctly in a hashed format.
From that point on they can login via mobile apps and API in general.

## Description

**Piwik login that uses LDAP queries to authenticate users and offeres Kerberos SSO support.**

#### HowTo Create a new User from LDAP in Piwik:
* Login to Piwik backend as superuser
* Navigate to Manage->LDAP Users
* If the LDAP Settings are correct you are now able to look up users from your directory

#### Note:
* Everytime a user is trying to login to your Piwik, the password is first of all checked
against your LDAP, if fails the plugin will check against the database.

#### Note2:
* Users may be modified and deleted via Manage->Users

#### Note3:
* If you change the username in LDAP/AD it will not be updated to Piwik!

#### Note4:
* When LDAP users are initially added on the \'Manage->LDAP Users\' page their password is not entered and stored in the database.
However, when they first login via the web interface their credentials will be saved correctly in a hashed format.
From that point on they can login via mobile apps and API in general.

## Description

**Piwik authentication module that allows users in LDAP to log in to Piwik. Supports web server authentication (eg, for Kerberos SSO).**

LoginLdap authenticates with an LDAP server and uses LDAP information to personalize Piwik.

When using LoginLdap, non-LDAP users stored in Piwik\'s DB will not be able to login, unless they are superusers.

## Installation

To start using LoginLdap, follow these steps:

1. Login as a superuser
2. On the _Manager > Plugins_ admin page, enable the LoginLdap plugin
3. Navigate to the _Settings > LDAP_ page
4. Enter and save settings for your LDAP servers

   _Note: You can test your servers by entering something into the \'Required User Group\' and clicking the test link that appears.
   An error message will display if LoginLdap cannot connect to the LDAP server._

5. You can now login with LDAP cedentials.

_**Note:** LDAP users are not synchronized with Piwik until they are first logged in. This means you cannot access a token auth for an LDAP user until the user is synchronized.
If you use the default LoginLdap configuration, you can synchronize all of your LDAP users at once using the `./console loginldap:synchronize-users` command._

## Upgrading from 2.2.7

Version 3.0.0 is a major rewrite of the plugin, so if you are upgrading for 2.2.7 you will have to do some extra work when upgrading:

- The admin user for servers must now be a full DN. In the LDAP settings page, change the admin name to be the full DN (ie, cn=...,dc=...).

- Uncheck the `Use LDAP for authentication` checkbox

  Version 2.2.7 and below used an authentication strategy where user passwords were stored both in Piwik and in LDAP. In order to keep your current
  users\' token auths from changing, that same strategy has to be used.

## Configurations

LoginLdap supports three different LDAP authentication strategies:

- logging in via LDAP only
- using LDAP for synchronization only
- logging in with Kerberos SSO (or something similar)

Each strategy has advantages and disadvantages. What you should use depends on your needs.

### Logging in via LDAP only

This strategy is more secure than the one below, but it requires connecting to the LDAP server on login.

With this strategy, every time a user logs in, LoginLdap will connect to LDAP to authenticate. On successful login, the user can
be synchronised, but the user\'s password is never stored in Piwik\'s DB, just LDAP. Additionally, the token auth is generated using
a hash of a hash of the password, or is generated randomly.

This means that if the Piwik DB is ever compromised, your LDAP users\' passwords will still be safe.

_Note: With this auth strategy, non-LDAP users cannot login unless they are superusers._

**Steps to enable**

_Note: this is the default configuration._

1. Check the `Use LDAP for authentication` option and uncheck the `Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)` option.

### Using LDAP for synchronization only

This strategy involves storing the user\'s passwords in the Piwik DB using Piwik\'s hashing, so it is not as secure as the above
method. If your Piwik DB is compromised, your LDAP users\' passwords will be in greater danger of being cracked.

But, this strategy does allow you to use LDAP authentication with normal Piwik authentication. And it opens up the possibility
of not communicating with LDAP servers at all during authentication, which may provide a better user experience.

_Note: With this auth strategy, non-LDAP users can login to Piwik._

**Steps to enable**

1. Uncheck the `Use LDAP for authentication` option and uncheck the `Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)` option.
2. If you don\'t want to connect to LDAP while logging in, uncheck the `Synchronize Users After Successful Login` option.
   
   a. If you uncheck this option, make sure your users are synchronized in some other way (eg, by using the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command).
      Piwik still needs information about your LDAP users in order to let them authenticate.

### Logging in with Kerberos SSO (or something similar)

This strategy delegates authentication to the webserver. You setup a system where the webserver authenticates the user and
sets the `$_SERVER[\'REMOTE_USER\']` server variable, and LoginLdap will assume the user is already authenticated.

This strategy will still connect to an LDAP server in order to synchronize user information, unless configured not to.

_Note: With this auth strategy, any user that appears as a REMOTE_USER can login, even if they are not in LDAP._

**Steps to enable**

1. Check the `Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)` option.
2. If you don\'t want to connect to LDAP while logging in, uncheck the `Synchronize Users After Successful Login` option.
   
   a. If you uncheck this option, make sure your users are synchronized in some other way (eg, by using the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command).
      Piwik still needs information about your LDAP users in order to let them authenticate.

## Features

### Authenticating with Kerberos

If you want to use Kerberos, check the **Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)** checkbox in the LDAP settings admin page.

Then, make sure your web server performs the necessary authentication and sets the `$_SERVER[\'REMOTE_USER\']` server variable when a user is authenticated.

When the `$_SERVER[\'REMOTE_USER\']` variable is set, LoginLdap will assume the user has already been authenticated.

_Note: The plugin will still communicate with the LDAP server in order to synchronize user details, so if LDAP settings are incorrect, authentication will fail._

### Specifying Fallback Servers

LoginLdap v3.0.0 and greater supports specifying multiple LDAP servers to use. If connecting to one server fails, the other servers are used as fallbacks.

You can enter fallback servers by adding new servers at the bottom of the _Settings > LDAP_ page.

### Filtering Users in LDAP

You can use the **Required User Group** and **LDAP Search Filter** settings to filter LDAP entries. Users whose entries do not match these filters
will not be allowed to authenticate.

Set **Required User Group** to the full DN of a group the user should be a member of. _Note: Internally, LoginLdap will issue a query using `(memberof=?)`
to find users of a certain group. Your server may require additional configuration to support `memberof`._

Set **LDAP Search Filter** to an LDAP filter string to use, for example: `(objectClass=person)` or
`(&(resMemberOf=cn=mygroup,ou=commonOU,dc=www,dc=example,dc=org)(objectclass=person))`.

You can test both of these settings from within the LDAP settings page.

### LDAP User Synchronization

LoginLdap will use information in LDAP to determine a user\'s alias and email address. On the _Settings > LDAP_ page, you can specify which LDAP attributes should be
use to determine these fields.

_Note: If the LDAP attribute for a user\'s alias is not found, the user\'s alias is defaulted to the first and last names of the user. On the settings page you can
specify which LDAP attributes are used to determine a user\'s first & last name._

**E-mail addresses**

E-mail addresses are required for Piwik users. If your users in LDAP do not have e-mail addresses, you can set the **E-mail Address Suffix** setting to an e-mail
address suffix, for example:

`@myorganization.com`

The suffix will be added to usernames to generate an e-mail address for your users.

Users are synchronized every time they log in. You can use the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command to synchronize users manually.

### Piwik Access Synchronization

LoginLdap also supports synchronizing access levels using attributes found in LDAP. To use this feature, first, you will need to modify your LDAP server\'s
schema and add three special attributes to user entries:

- an attribute to specify the sites a user has view access to
- an attribute to specify the sites a user has admin access to
- and an attribute used to specify if a user is a superuser or not

_Note: You can choose whatever names you want for these attributes. You will be able to tell LoginLdap about these names in the LDAP settings page._

Then you must set these attributes correctly within LDAP, for example:

- `view: all`
- `admin: 1,2,3`
- `superuser: 1`

Finally, in the LDAP settings page, check the **Enable User Access Synchronization from LDAP** checkbox and fill out the settings that appear below it.

User access synchronization occurs with normal user synchronization. So the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command can be used for this as well.

#### Managing Access for Multiple Piwik Instances

LoginLdap supports using a single LDAP server to manage access for multiple Piwik instances. If you\'d like to use this feature, you must specify special values
for LDAP access attributes. For example:

- `view: mypiwikserver.whatever.com:1,2,3;myotherserver.com:all`
- `admin: mypiwikserver.whatever.com:all;mythirdserver.com:3,4`
- `superuser: myotherserver.com;myotherserver.com/otherpiwik`

If you don\'t want to use URLs in your access attributes, you can use the **Special Name For This Piwik Instance** setting to specify a special name
for each of your Piwiks. For example, if you set it to \'piwikServerA\' in one Piwik and \'piwikServerB\' in another, your LDAP attributes might look
like:

- `view: piwikServerA:1,2,3;piwikServerB:all`
- `admin: piwikServerA:4,5,6`
- `superuser: piwikServerC`

**Using a custom access attribute format**

You can customize the separators used in access attributes by setting the **User Access Attribute Server Specification Delimiter** and
**User Access Attribute Server & Site List Separator** settings.

If you set the **User Access Attribute Server Specification Delimiter** option to `\'#\'`, access attributes can be specified as:

`view: piwikServerA:1,2,3#piwikServerB:all`

If you set the **User Access Attribute Server & Site List Separator** option to `\'#\'`, access attributes can be specified as:

`view: piwikServerA#1,2,3;piwikServerB#all`

## Security Considerations

**User passwords**

For added security, LoginLdap\'s default configuration will not store user passwords or a hash of a user password within Piwik\'s DB. So if the Piwik DB is compromised
for whatever reason, user passwords will not be compromised.

**Token Auths**

LDAP has no concept of authentication tokens, so user token_auths are stored exclusively in Piwik\'s MySQL DB. If a token auth is compromised,
you can have Piwik generate a new one by changing a user\'s password in LDAP.

If you\'ve enabled the `Generate Random token_auth For New Users` option and a token auth is compromised, you\'ll have to run the
`loginldap:generate-token-auth` command to generate a new one.

**Logging**

LoginLdap uses debug logging extensively so problems can be diagnosed quickly. The logs should not contain sensitive information, but _you
should still disable DEBUG logging in production_.

If you need to debug a problem, enable it temporarily by changing the `[log] log_level` and `[log] log_writers` core INI config options.
If you use file logs, make sure to delete the logs after you are finished debugging.

## Commands

LoginLdap comes with the following console commands:

* `loginldap:generate-token-auth`: Regenerates a token auth for a user if the `Generate Random token_auth For New Users` option is currently
  enabled.

* `loginldap:synchronize-users`: Can be used to synchronize one, multiple, or all users in LDAP at once. If you\'d like to setup user access
  within Piwik before a user logs in, this command should be used.

## Description

**Piwik authentication module that allows users in LDAP to log in to Piwik. Supports web server authentication (eg, for Kerberos SSO).**

LoginLdap authenticates with an LDAP server and uses LDAP information to personalize Piwik.

When using LoginLdap, non-LDAP users stored in Piwik\'s DB will not be able to login, unless they are superusers.

## Installation

To start using LoginLdap, follow these steps:

1. Login as a superuser
2. On the _Manager > Plugins_ admin page, enable the LoginLdap plugin
3. Navigate to the _Settings > LDAP_ page
4. Enter and save settings for your LDAP servers

   _Note: You can test your servers by entering something into the \'Required User Group\' and clicking the test link that appears.
   An error message will display if LoginLdap cannot connect to the LDAP server._

5. You can now login with LDAP cedentials.

_**Note:** LDAP users are not synchronized with Piwik until they are first logged in. This means you cannot access a token auth for an LDAP user until the user is synchronized.
If you use the default LoginLdap configuration, you can synchronize all of your LDAP users at once using the `./console loginldap:synchronize-users` command._

## Upgrading from 2.2.7

Version 3.0.0 is a major rewrite of the plugin, so if you are upgrading for 2.2.7 you will have to do some extra work when upgrading:

- The admin user for servers must now be a full DN. In the LDAP settings page, change the admin name to be the full DN (ie, cn=...,dc=...).

- Uncheck the `Use LDAP for authentication` checkbox

  Version 2.2.7 and below used an authentication strategy where user passwords were stored both in Piwik and in LDAP. In order to keep your current
  users\' token auths from changing, that same strategy has to be used.

## Configurations

LoginLdap supports three different LDAP authentication strategies:

- logging in via LDAP only
- using LDAP for synchronization only
- logging in with Kerberos SSO (or something similar)

Each strategy has advantages and disadvantages. What you should use depends on your needs.

### Logging in via LDAP only

This strategy is more secure than the one below, but it requires connecting to the LDAP server on login.

With this strategy, every time a user logs in, LoginLdap will connect to LDAP to authenticate. On successful login, the user can
be synchronised, but the user\'s password is never stored in Piwik\'s DB, just LDAP. Additionally, the token auth is generated using
a hash of a hash of the password, or is generated randomly.

This means that if the Piwik DB is ever compromised, your LDAP users\' passwords will still be safe.

_Note: With this auth strategy, non-LDAP users cannot login unless they are superusers._

**Steps to enable**

_Note: this is the default configuration._

1. Check the `Use LDAP for authentication` option and uncheck the `Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)` option.

### Using LDAP for synchronization only

This strategy involves storing the user\'s passwords in the Piwik DB using Piwik\'s hashing, so it is not as secure as the above
method. If your Piwik DB is compromised, your LDAP users\' passwords will be in greater danger of being cracked.

But, this strategy does allow you to use LDAP authentication with normal Piwik authentication. And it opens up the possibility
of not communicating with LDAP servers at all during authentication, which may provide a better user experience.

_Note: With this auth strategy, non-LDAP users can login to Piwik._

**Steps to enable**

1. Uncheck the `Use LDAP for authentication` option and uncheck the `Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)` option.
2. If you don\'t want to connect to LDAP while logging in, uncheck the `Synchronize Users After Successful Login` option.
   
   a. If you uncheck this option, make sure your users are synchronized in some other way (eg, by using the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command).
      Piwik still needs information about your LDAP users in order to let them authenticate.

### Logging in with Kerberos SSO (or something similar)

This strategy delegates authentication to the webserver. You setup a system where the webserver authenticates the user and
sets the `$_SERVER[\'REMOTE_USER\']` server variable, and LoginLdap will assume the user is already authenticated.

This strategy will still connect to an LDAP server in order to synchronize user information, unless configured not to.

_Note: With this auth strategy, any user that appears as a REMOTE_USER can login, even if they are not in LDAP._

**Steps to enable**

1. Check the `Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)` option.
2. If you don\'t want to connect to LDAP while logging in, uncheck the `Synchronize Users After Successful Login` option.
   
   a. If you uncheck this option, make sure your users are synchronized in some other way (eg, by using the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command).
      Piwik still needs information about your LDAP users in order to let them authenticate.

## Features

### Authenticating with Kerberos

If you want to use Kerberos, check the **Use Web Server Auth (e.g. Kerberos SSO)** checkbox in the LDAP settings admin page.

Then, make sure your web server performs the necessary authentication and sets the `$_SERVER[\'REMOTE_USER\']` server variable when a user is authenticated.

When the `$_SERVER[\'REMOTE_USER\']` variable is set, LoginLdap will assume the user has already been authenticated.

_Note: The plugin will still communicate with the LDAP server in order to synchronize user details, so if LDAP settings are incorrect, authentication will fail._

### Specifying Fallback Servers

LoginLdap v3.0.0 and greater supports specifying multiple LDAP servers to use. If connecting to one server fails, the other servers are used as fallbacks.

You can enter fallback servers by adding new servers at the bottom of the _Settings > LDAP_ page.

### Filtering Users in LDAP

You can use the **Required User Group** and **LDAP Search Filter** settings to filter LDAP entries. Users whose entries do not match these filters
will not be allowed to authenticate.

Set **Required User Group** to the full DN of a group the user should be a member of. _Note: Internally, LoginLdap will issue a query using `(memberof=?)`
to find users of a certain group. Your server may require additional configuration to support `memberof`._

Set **LDAP Search Filter** to an LDAP filter string to use, for example: `(objectClass=person)` or
`(&(resMemberOf=cn=mygroup,ou=commonOU,dc=www,dc=example,dc=org)(objectclass=person))`.

You can test both of these settings from within the LDAP settings page.

### LDAP User Synchronization

LoginLdap will use information in LDAP to determine a user\'s alias and email address. On the _Settings > LDAP_ page, you can specify which LDAP attributes should be
use to determine these fields.

_Note: If the LDAP attribute for a user\'s alias is not found, the user\'s alias is defaulted to the first and last names of the user. On the settings page you can
specify which LDAP attributes are used to determine a user\'s first & last name._

**E-mail addresses**

E-mail addresses are required for Piwik users. If your users in LDAP do not have e-mail addresses, you can set the **E-mail Address Suffix** setting to an e-mail
address suffix, for example:

`@myorganization.com`

The suffix will be added to usernames to generate an e-mail address for your users.

Users are synchronized every time they log in. You can use the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command to synchronize users manually.

### Piwik Access Synchronization

LoginLdap also supports synchronizing access levels using attributes found in LDAP. To use this feature, first, you will need to modify your LDAP server\'s
schema and add three special attributes to user entries:

- an attribute to specify the sites a user has view access to
- an attribute to specify the sites a user has admin access to
- and an attribute used to specify if a user is a superuser or not

_Note: You can choose whatever names you want for these attributes. You will be able to tell LoginLdap about these names in the LDAP settings page._

Then you must set these attributes correctly within LDAP, for example:

- `view: all`
- `admin: 1,2,3`
- `superuser: 1`

Finally, in the LDAP settings page, check the **Enable User Access Synchronization from LDAP** checkbox and fill out the settings that appear below it.

User access synchronization occurs with normal user synchronization. So the `loginldap:synchronize-users` command can be used for this as well.

#### Managing Access for Multiple Piwik Instances

LoginLdap supports using a single LDAP server to manage access for multiple Piwik instances. If you\'d like to use this feature, you must specify special values
for LDAP access attributes. For example:

- `view: mypiwikserver.whatever.com:1,2,3;myotherserver.com:all`
- `admin: mypiwikserver.whatever.com:all;mythirdserver.com:3,4`
- `superuser: myotherserver.com;myotherserver.com/otherpiwik`

If you don\'t want to use URLs in your access attributes, you can use the **Special Name For This Piwik Instance** setting to specify a special name
for each of your Piwiks. For example, if you set it to \'piwikServerA\' in one Piwik and \'piwikServerB\' in another, your LDAP attributes might look
like:

- `view: piwikServerA:1,2,3;piwikServerB:all`
- `admin: piwikServerA:4,5,6`
- `superuser: piwikServerC`

**Using a custom access attribute format**

You can customize the separators used in access attributes by setting the **User Access Attribute Server Specification Delimiter** and
**User Access Attribute Server & Site List Separator** settings.

If you set the **User Access Attribute Server Specification Delimiter** option to `\'#\'`, access attributes can be specified as:

`view: piwikServerA:1,2,3#piwikServerB:all`

If you set the **User Access Attribute Server & Site List Separator** option to `\'#\'`, access attributes can be specified as:

`view: piwikServerA#1,2,3;piwikServerB#all`

## Security Considerations

**User passwords**

For added security, LoginLdap\'s default configuration will not store user passwords or a hash of a user password within Piwik\'s DB. So if the Piwik DB is compromised
for whatever reason, user passwords will not be compromised.

**Token Auths**

LDAP has no concept of authentication tokens, so user token_auths are stored exclusively in Piwik\'s MySQL DB. If a token auth is compromised,
you can have Piwik generate a new one by changing a user\'s password in LDAP.

If you\'ve enabled the `Generate Random token_auth For New Users` option and a token auth is compromised, you\'ll have to run the
`loginldap:generate-token-auth` command to generate a new one.

**Logging**

LoginLdap uses debug logging extensively so problems can be diagnosed quickly. The logs should not contain sensitive information, but _you
should still disable DEBUG logging in production_.

If you need to debug a problem, enable it temporarily by changing the `[log] log_level` and `[log] log_writers` core INI config options.
If you use file logs, make sure to delete the logs after you are finished debugging.

## Commands

LoginLdap comes with the following console commands:

* `loginldap:generate-token-auth`: Regenerates a token auth for a user if the `Generate Random token_auth For New Users` option is currently
  enabled.

* `loginldap:synchronize-users`: Can be used to synchronize one, multiple, or all users in LDAP at once. If you\'d like to setup user access
  within Piwik before a user logs in, this command should be used.

## Description

This is a plugin for Piwik that generates reports about the IPv6 reach of your websites. It is written as a tracker plugin and directly hooks into the Piwik tracking call.

## Documentation

I wrote an article about the development that lead to this plugin and explained how the plugin works internally. You can find the article at [Geekmonkey](http://geekmonkey.org/articles/34-how-to-write-a-piwik-plugin)

There is also a [short article](http://geekmonkey.org/articles/33-tracking-the-ipv6-reach-of-your-website-with-piwik/) that explains how to setup the plugin.

## Description

Create Custom Alerts + Be notified by email/SMS!

Alerts are a great way to get notified of changes on your website. Want to know if your new product hits less than 100 sales in a week or your new article attracts more than 200 visitors a day?

## Description

Create Custom Alerts + Be notified by email/SMS!

Alerts are a great way to get notified of changes on your website. Want to know if your new product hits less than 100 sales in a week or your new article attracts more than 200 visitors a day? Create alerts that make sense to you. Be notified by email or SMS when the conditions for your alerts are met. Stay on top of your website!

The Alert log will help you to better understand the success of your website. You can use it to analyze how often your website hit more than 10000 visits per day or on how many days a product was sold more than 50 times.

This plugin was [crowdfunded with the support](http://crowdfunding.piwik.org/custom-alerts-plugin/) of 37 Piwik community members!

Piwik plugin to locate all locale data of a user based on the IP address/subnetwork (country, region, city, latitude, longitude, provider, ...)

## FAQ

__What statistics are available?__

If you create a full configuration data file, you\'ll see
* Visitor -> Realtime visitor map
* Visitor -> Location and provider
* and many more...

__Why there stands provider "unknown" in my visitor log?__

If your installation is stock, all visitors will get this "flag" to show you, what IPs are not matched.
You can adjust or remove this, by changing the "noMatch" block in your `data.php` file.
If you remove the complete block, none matched visitors will be skipped by this plugin.
But you can also fill all possible visitorInfos like you are used for matched IP addresses.


__How to configure/install this plugin / the networks?__

After installation and activation of the plugin, open the file `piwik/plugins/IntranetGeoIp/data.php`

You can their add your location information and their subnetworks.

## Description

Piwik plugin to locate all locale data of a user based on the IP address/subnetwork (country, region, city, latitude, longitude, provider, ...)

***Please use it only for INTRANET tracking*** everything else just dont make sense :-)

## FAQ

__What does this plugin do?__

It adds visitor information based on the matched IP address from your configuration. Not more and not less.
The database schema and UI stays untouched, so all Piwik statistics can be used like you would use a internet GeoIP database.


__How to configure/install this plugin / the networks?__

After installation and activation of the plugin, open the file `piwik/config/IntranetGeoIP.data.php`

You can their add your location information and their subnetworks.

See the file `piwik/config/IntranetGeoIP.data.php` or see the readme on github https://github.com/ThaDafinser/IntranetGeoIp


__What statistics are available?__

If you create a full configuration data file, you\'ll see
* Visitor -> Realtime visitor map
* Visitor -> Location and provider
* and many more...(in generall all statistics are available like using a internet GeoIP database)


__Why there stands provider "unknown" in my visitor log?__

If your installation is stock, all visitors will get this "flag" to show you, what IPs are not matched.
You can adjust or remove this, by changing the "noMatch" block in your `IntranetGeoIP.data.php` file.
If you remove the complete block, none matched visitors will be skipped by this plugin.
But you can also fill all possible visitorInfos like you are used for matched IP addresses.


__Can i use this plugin with a internet GeoIP database side by side?__

Yes you can.
Just remove or comment out the `noMatch` block in your configuration file.

__Note about the configuration?__

Inside the array key `visitorInfo` you can freely add/remove all available columns from the `log_visit` table you want.
The keys below are just a suggestion, since they are the only one which make sense currently IMO.
All available fields, see here: http://developer.piwik.org/guides/persistence-and-the-mysql-backend#visits

Inside they key `networks` add all subnetworks which apply to this location.

```php
return [
    /*
     * If the IP was not matched, apply these data to visitorInfo
     * You can also apply here all possible visitorInformation data if you want
     */

## Description

This plugin extends the standard Piwik authentication to use Basic HTTP Authentication.

## Installation

* Login your Piwik as Super User. Click Settings. Click Marketplace.
* Install the LoginHttpAuth plugin, then click Activate.
* Click Settings, then click Users.
    * Create a user in Piwik for each user that should have access to Piwik.

    * generate a .htpasswd file with your encrypted logins and passwords
    * [copy this example .htaccess file](https://github.com/piwik/plugin-LoginHttpAuth/blob/master/TemplateHtaccess/.htaccess) in the root directory of Piwik, and set the path to your .htpasswd file
* When you go to Piwik, you will see the Authentication window.
  Congratulations! You are now using HTTP Auth to protect Piwik.

## Changelog

## Description

This [Piwik](http://piwik.org) Plugin avoids regular users choosing date ranges as their default setting trying to save server resources.

Each time users asks for ranged date reports, Piwik builds it on the fly during user\'s request.
This slows down the server when you have a big amount of visits and a large number of tracked websites.
This action is resource intensive so when it happens, live tracking may become slow or inaccurate.

## Installation

Please, read official [Piwik\'s documentation](http://piwik.org/faq/plugins/#faq_21) about it.

## FAQ

__Is there any user interface configuration?__
No, any. You don\'t have to configure things, only to activate or deactivate the plugin.

__Can I contribute on development?__

## Description

This [Piwik](http://piwik.org) Plugin lets you hide custom date range selection from calendar for regular users,
also lets you avoid users setting ranges as default value in their profile.

Each time users asks for ranged date reports, Piwik builds it on the fly during user\'s browsing.
This slows down your server when there is a load of visits and a large number of tracked websites.
As you can see this action is resource intensive so when it happens, live websites tracking may become slow or inaccurate.

Installing this plugin you remove choices in the field _"Report date to load by default"_ in _User Settings page_ for all regular users.
Superadmin users setting page remains untouched and administrators will see only a notification about plugin\'s current behavior.

Another plugin\'s feature is regular users can\'t select any more a custom range in the calendar but Superadmins still can build reports.

You can enable or disable the two features independently by clicking checkboxes in the plugin\'s configuration page available in the super admin user interface.

This plugin is translated in: English, Italian and French (just send a pull request to include your favourite language, see _Can I contribute_ f.a.q.)

## Installation

## Description

This [Piwik](http://piwik.org) Plugin lets you hide custom date range selection from calendar for regular users,
also lets you avoid users setting ranges as default value in their profile.

Each time users asks for ranged date reports, Piwik builds it on the fly during user\'s browsing.
This slows down your server when there is a load of visits and a large number of tracked websites.
As you can see this action is resource intensive so when it happens, live websites tracking may become slow or inaccurate.

Installing this plugin you remove choices in the field _"Report date to load by default"_ in _User Settings page_ for all regular users.
Superadmin users setting page remains untouched and administrators will see only a notification about plugin\'s current behavior.

Another plugin\'s feature is regular users can\'t select any more a custom range in the calendar but Superadmins still can build reports.

You can enable or disable the two features independently by clicking checkboxes in the plugin\'s configuration page available in the super admin user interface.

This plugin is translated in: English, Italian and French (just send a pull request to include your favourite language, see _Can I contribute_ f.a.q.)

## Installation

Please, read official [Piwik\'s documentation](http://piwik.org/faq/plugins/#faq_21) about it.

## FAQ

<p>This <a href="http://piwik.org">Piwik</a> Plugin lets you hide custom date range selection from calendar for regular users,
also lets you avoid users setting ranges as default value in their profile.</p>

<p>Each time users asks for ranged date reports, Piwik builds it on the fly during user\'s browsing.
This slows down your server when there is a load of visits and a large number of tracked websites.
As you can see this action is resource intensive so when it happens, live websites tracking may become slow or inaccurate.</p>

<p>Installing this plugin you remove choices in the field <em>"Report date to load by default"</em> in <em>User Settings page</em> for all regular users.
Superadmin users setting page remains untouched and administrators will see only a notification about plugin\'s current behavior.</p>

<p>Another plugin\'s feature is regular users can\'t select any more a custom range in the calendar but Superadmins still can build reports.</p>

<p>Since Piwik 2.4.0 you can enable or disable the two features independently by clicking checkboxes in the plugin\'s configuration page available in the super admin user interface.</p>

<p>This plugin is translated in: English, Italian and French (just send a pull request to include your favourite language, see <em>Can I contribute</em> f.a.q.)</p>

<p><strong>I would like to see a demonstration...</strong>
Just take a look at <em>screenshots</em> .</p>

<p><strong>Can I donate to you?</strong>
Thanks but we can\'t accept money donations because we\'re a Government Organization.
All donation are linked to official Piwik project\'s accounts, simply help them to help us.</p>

Engage people you don\'t know at all, with this targeted and efficient chat system, directly integrated into Piwik.
The client has these three states, plus a minimized state :

![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState2.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 2")
![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState3.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 3")
![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState4.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 4")

And here is the updated Visitor Profile :
![Backend](/screenshots/BackendVisitorProfile.png?raw=true "Visitor Profile in Backend")

## Installation
Add this code, after Piwik\'s tracking code :

    <!-- Piwik Chat -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        (function() {
            var u=(("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://{$PIWIK_URL}/" : "http://{$PIWIK_URL}/");
            var d=document, g=d.createElement(\'script\'), s=d.getElementsByTagName(\'script\')[0]; g.type=\'text/javascript\';
            g.defer=true; g.async=true; g.src=u+\'plugins/Chat/javascripts/client/client.js\'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
    </script>
    <!-- End Piwik Chat Code -->

## How it works
On the backend, this plugin modifies the visitorProfile popup, by adding to it a "Chat" tab next to "Visited pages". A new menu "Chat" is available, which allows to browse all conversations.

Soon, a reporting system will be integrated, which will show figures like conversion rate or engagement, in function of the Chat\'s use.

After installing the plugin, you have to modify your tracking code. It includes the file "javascripts/client/client.js", which waits for the Tracker() to initialize, then appends an iframe to the page. This iframe requests the "popout" action of the controller, where the plugin tries to identify the visitor based on his visitorID or configID.

## Changelog
v0.1 :

+   Basic chat functions with client/server communication and Piwik integration
+   Add additional inputs in the visitor profile in order to save personal informations about a visitor (name, email, phone and comments)
+   The client shows if someone of the staff is online or not

## Roadmap
v0.2 :

*   Add a reporting system that shows figures about the module impact
*   Add external cache support for polling (APC, Memcache, opCache...)

v0.3 :

*   Add support for automatic messages by segment recognition

## Academical study
As an MSc student in eBusiness, this project is part of my final dissertation : "How to engage people you don\'t know at all ?".

The first part of this project is to develop the module and its reporting system. Then, the second part will be about analyse the impact of this Chat system (conversion rate, engagement, etc..) in function of its use, and eventually try to determine which way of use is the most efficient. From this research it may be possible to provide advices and answer questions like : What is the best behavior to adopt as an operator? What kinds of automatic messages are the more efficient in order to increase conversion?

To lead this study, I will need data! And if you support my work, you\'ll be able to send me your reports via the plugin, in an anonymized way.',

Then, the second part will be about analyse the impact of this Chat system (conversion rate, engagement, etc..) in function of its use, and eventually try to determine which way of use is the most efficient. From this research it may be possible to provide advices and answer questions like : What is the best behavior to adopt as an operator? What kinds of automatic messages are the more efficient in order to increase conversion?

To lead this study, I will need data! And if you support my work, you\'ll be able to send me your reports via the plugin, in an anonymized way.',

Engage people you don\'t know at all, with this targeted and efficient chat system, directly integrated into Piwik.

The client has these three states, plus a minimized state :

![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState2.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 2")
![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState3.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 3")
![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState4.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 4")

And here is the updated Visitor Profile :
![Backend](/screenshots/BackendVisitorProfile.png?raw=true "Visitor Profile in Backend")

## Installation
Add this code, after Piwik\'s tracking code :

    <!-- Piwik Chat -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        (function() {
            var u=(("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://{$PIWIK_URL}/" : "http://{$PIWIK_URL}/");
            var d=document, g=d.createElement(\'script\'), s=d.getElementsByTagName(\'script\')[0]; g.type=\'text/javascript\';
            g.defer=true; g.async=true; g.src=u+\'plugins/Chat/javascripts/client/client.js\'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
    </script>
    <!-- End Piwik Chat Code -->

## How it works
On the backend, this plugin modifies the visitorProfile popup, by adding to it a "Chat" tab next to "Visited pages". A new menu "Chat" is available, which allows to browse all conversations.

Soon, a reporting system will be integrated, which will show figures like conversion rate or engagement, in function of the Chat\'s use.

After installing the plugin, you have to modify your tracking code. It includes the file "javascripts/client/client.js", which waits for the Tracker() to initialize, then appends an iframe to the page. This iframe requests the "popout" action of the controller, where the plugin tries to identify the visitor based on his visitorID or configID.

This plugin is not production ready, but any help is appreciate!

Engage people you don\'t know at all, with this targeted and efficient chat system, directly integrated into Piwik.

The client has these three states, plus a minimized state :

![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState2.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 2")
![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState3.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 3")
![Chat Client](/screenshots/ClientState4.png?raw=true "Chat Client State 4")

And here is the updated Visitor Profile :
![Backend](/screenshots/BackendVisitorProfile.png?raw=true "Visitor Profile in Backend")

## Installation
Add this code, after Piwik\'s tracking code :

    <!-- Piwik Chat -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        (function() {
            var u=(("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://{$PIWIK_URL}/" : "http://{$PIWIK_URL}/");
            var d=document, g=d.createElement(\'script\'), s=d.getElementsByTagName(\'script\')[0]; g.type=\'text/javascript\';
            g.defer=true; g.async=true; g.src=u+\'plugins/Chat/javascripts/client/client.js\'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
    </script>
    <!-- End Piwik Chat Code -->

## How it works
On the backend, this plugin modifies the visitorProfile popup, by adding to it a "Chat" tab next to "Visited pages". A new menu "Chat" is available, which allows to browse all conversations.

Soon, a reporting system will be integrated, which will show figures like conversion rate or engagement, in function of the Chat\'s use.

After installing the plugin, you have to modify your tracking code. It includes the file "javascripts/client/client.js", which waits for the Tracker() to initialize, then appends an iframe to the page. This iframe requests the "popout" action of the controller, where the plugin tries to identify the visitor based on his visitorID or configID.

## Academical study
As an MSc student in eBusiness, this project is part of my final dissertation : "How to engage people you don\'t know at all ?".

The first part of this project is to develop the module and its reporting system. Then, the second part will be about analyse the impact of this Chat system (conversion rate, engagement, etc..) in function of its use, and eventually try to determine which way of use is the most efficient. From this research it may be possible to provide advices and answer questions like : What is the best behavior to adopt as an operator? What kinds of automatic messages are the more efficient in order to increase conversion?

To lead this study, I will need data! And if you support my work, you\'ll be able to send me your reports via the plugin, in an anonymized way.',

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. If enabled, it will add a new widget that you can add to your dashboard an a new link in the top navigation.

The widget will show the performance index of a site that auto-refresh every 30 seconds. It shows the number of visitors or visit time in a 30 minute period compared to the maximum number of visitors in any 30 minute period of the last 30 days.

This plugin is inspired by the [piwik barometer plugin](https://github.com/halfdan/piwik-barometer-plugin) and uses a lightly modified jQuery-Dynameter (original by [Tzechiu Lei](http://tze1.com/dynameter/).

**This plugin should run fine with installations with up to 100.000 page impressions per day. If you run a very large piwik installation and have performance issues with this plugin, please contact me - there is a solution for this. I have it up and running in an installation with more than 5 million visits per day.**

(Tested with piwik 2.5.0, but supposed to run with older versions)

## Installation

Install it via Piwik Marketplace OR install manually:

1. Clone the plugin into the plugins directory of your Piwik installation.

   ```
   cd plugins/
   git clone https://github.com/chanzler/piwik-performance-monitor.git PerformanceMonitor
   ```

2. Login as superuser into your Piwik installation and activate the plugin under Settings -> Plugins

3. You will now find the widget under the Live! section.

## FAQ

Here is a list of features that are included in this project:

* Define new widget ("Performance Monitor")
* Add an item to the top navigation ("Performance overview") which displays the performance monitor widget for all your configured sites.

## FAQ

###Features
Here is a list of features that are included in this project:

* Live widget ("Performance Monitor") with key performance indices
* Add an item to the top navigation ("Performance overview") which displays the performance monitor widget for all your sites (configurable).

###Configuration
*Refresh interval*: Defines how often the widgets will be updated. Every 30 seconds is a good value to choose.

*Measurement period*: Defines the measurement period in minutes. 5 minutes is a good value to choose.

*Comparison period*: Defines the period (x * 24h) the last 30 minutes are compared to. A good value for small sites with more or less static content is 30. For sites with peak days on weekends for example 1 will be a good value. 1 is also a good value for very big sites with a lot of traffic. You will have to play around with this value a little bit and figure out whalt will fit your needs.

*Sites in overview*: Defines which sites are displayed in the overview.  

## Changelog

### 0.2.0 Second Beta
* made the plugin configurable by settings
* added more key performance indices
* performance overview now links to the dashboards
* fixed the timezone bug (configure timezone for each site properly)
* fixed several minor bugs

### 0.1.0 First Beta
* initial release

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. If enabled, it will add a new widget that you can add to your dashboard and a new link in the top navigation.

The widget will show the performance index of a site that auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. It shows the number of visitors or visit time in a 30 minute period compared to the maximum number of visitors in any 30 minute period of the last 30 days.

This plugin is inspired by the [piwik barometer plugin](https://github.com/halfdan/piwik-barometer-plugin) and uses a lightly modified jQuery-Dynameter (original by [Tzechiu Lei](http://tze1.com/dynameter/).

**This plugin should run fine with installations with up to 100.000 page impressions per day. If you run a very large piwik installation and have performance issues with this plugin, please contact me - there is a solution for this. I have it up and running in an installation with more than 5 million visits per day.**

(Tested with piwik 2.7.0, but supposed to run with older versions)

## Installation

Install it via Piwik Marketplace OR install manually:

1. Clone the plugin into the plugins directory of your Piwik installation.

   ```
   cd plugins/
   git clone https://github.com/chanzler/piwik-performance-monitor.git PerformanceMonitor
   ```

2. Login as superuser into your Piwik installation and activate the plugin under Settings -> Plugins

3. You will now find the widget under the Live! section.

4. When you update: As there have been made several changes in v0.2.0 you might have to clear your cache (console core:clear-caches)

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. If enabled, it will add a new widget that you can add to your dashboard and a new link in the top navigation.

The widget will show the performance index of a site that auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. It shows the number of visitors or visit time in a 30 minute period compared to the maximum number of visitors in any 30 minute period of the last 30 days.

This plugin is inspired by the [piwik barometer plugin](https://github.com/halfdan/piwik-barometer-plugin) and uses a lightly modified jQuery-Dynameter (original by [Tzechiu Lei](http://tze1.com/dynameter/).

**This plugin should run fine with installations with up to 100.000 page impressions per day. If you run a very large piwik installation and have performance issues with this plugin, please contact me - there is a solution for this. I have it up and running in an installation with more than 5 million visits per day.**

(Tested with piwik 2.7.0, but supposed to run with older versions)

## Installation

Install it via Piwik Marketplace OR install manually:

1. Clone the plugin into the plugins directory of your Piwik installation.

   ```
   cd plugins/
   git clone https://github.com/chanzler/piwik-performance-monitor.git PerformanceMonitor
   ```

2. Login as superuser into your Piwik installation and activate the plugin under Settings -> Plugins

3. You will now find the widget under the Live! section.

4. When you update: As there have been made several changes in v0.2.0 you might have to clear your cache (console core:clear-caches)

You need so track a custom user (username, mail, ...) visitor variable, so this plugin know which user shall be fetched from LDAP.
Please see the official documentation: http://piwik.org/docs/custom-variables/ or http://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/tracking-javascript#custom-variables

  * Corrections and error trapping for shared websites where the some values aren\'t accessible 


## FAQ

**How is the CPU load calculated?**  
For the CPU load the PHP function sys_getloadavg() is used and divided by the number of cores.

**Why is there a difference between free and used memory?**  
There are three "memory parts" under Linux:   

* Used memory
* Cache
* Free memory

The sum of these three parts will be equal to the total memory. But only `used memory` and `free memory` are available as options.

**Does the plugin work on a shared webspace?**  
In the most cases a shared webspace doesn\'t have access to system information. Therefore in these cases, the plugin cannot be used.

**Does the plugin work on Windows system?**  
If the server where Piwik is running is using Windows as OS, the plugin doesn\'t work yet.  
If just your browser is running under Windows (and the server runs under Linux) this plugin works well.

**Analyze how visitors navigate between your websites.**

## Description

Measures number of visits and unique visitors that have navigated across two or three specific websites. _(Unique user is determined across websites using the fingerprint config_id stored._

## Features

### See how many visitors visited more than one of your websites.

To access this functionality, navigate to the All Websites dashboard. Here there will be a new link that says _Number of visitors who viewed several websites_. Click this link and a dialog will display that will allow you to get visitor metrics for many sites.

### _Those are all the features available right now._

This plugin is very new, so there is only one. However! We have big plans for this plugin and will be working to include many new and mind-bending features.

## Description

Configurable piwik plugin to create an LDAP connection, which can be reused by other plugins.
Is uses the ZF2 Ldap component: http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/index.html#zend-ldap

Currently used by https://github.com/ThaDafinser/LdapVisitorInfo

## FAQ

__Why is PIWIK 2.5 required?__

Because the configuration (to be explicit accountFilterFormat) is destroyed in the previous version
See the ticket here: https://github.com/piwik/piwik/issues/5890


__What does this plugin do?__

It creates based on your configuration a connection to LDAP. Not more and not less :-)


__How can i use this LDAP connection in another plugin?__

This is an example to retrieve the connection.

## Description

Configurable piwik plugin to create an LDAP connection, which can be reused by other plugins.
Is uses the ZF2 Ldap component: http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/index.html#zend-ldap

Currently used by https://github.com/ThaDafinser/LdapVisitorInfo

## FAQ

__Why is PIWIK 2.5 required?__

Because the configuration (to be explicit accountFilterFormat) is destroyed in the previous version
See the ticket here: https://github.com/piwik/piwik/issues/5890


__What does this plugin do?__

It creates based on your configuration a connection to LDAP. Not more and not less :-)


__How can i use this LDAP connection in another plugin?__

This is an example to retrieve the connection.
For documentation please see http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/index.html#zend-ldap

## Description

Track up to five Campaigns parameters (name, source, medium, keyword, content), and access Campaign Analytics reports.


## Measuring campaigns

The default Campaign parameters are called: pk_campaign, pk_source, pk_medium, pk_keyword, pk_content and pk_cid.

If you already have URLs tagged with Google Analytics parameters these are supported: utm_campaign, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_term, utm_content and utm_id

An example landing page URL is:
```
/offer?pk_campaign=Best-Seller&pk_source=Newsletter_7&pk_medium=email
```

## Features
 * Real time Analytics Reports of all your Campaign Marketing
 * Detects Campaign parameters from the landing page URL, within the query string or in the #hash string
 * The Referrers>Overview report displays a left column "Referrers Overview" with a list of reports that can be loaded on click.
   This report viewer now also lists the new Campaign reports under "View Referrers by Campaign".
 * The content of Referrers> Campaign will be replaced with the new enhanced Campaigns reports.
 * The default Referrers Campaign widget and API are working as before.
 * The campaign reports are available in Piwik Mobile and can be sent as Scheduled reports (by email, as HTML or PDF)
 * Segment editor: a new "Campaigns" category lists the five new segment for each campaign dimension
 * The new Campaign reports can be added as widgets in your personalized Dashboard
 * Access the Campaign Report data by the API
 * Comes with automated tests to ensure the Plugin works as expected
 * Will track up to 250 characters for each of the five Campaign dimension

## Notes
 * To archive all values in the Campaign reports and not truncate rows, set eg.

```
[General]

datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_referrers = 10000

datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_subtable_referrers = 10000
```

## Ideas for improvement
 * To improve data acquisition accuracy, we could extend the piwik.js class to store in first party cookies
 the five campaign dimensions. This would increase the accuracy of Goal conversions and Ecommerce conversions attributions
 for these conversions made at least one day after the first visit with a campaign set.
 * Add friendly Tracking API parameters to collect campaign dimensions.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PiwikPRO/plugin-CustomTrackerJs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PiwikPRO/plugin-CustomTrackerJs)

## Description

The `CustomTrackerJs` plugin lets the super users or other plugins add custom code to the Piwik Javascript Tracker.

## Usage

### Super users

Super users can set the Javascript code they want to add to the `piwik.js` file in `Settings > Plugin settings`.

Any code added in the *Javascript code* textbox will be appended to `piwik.js` by a scheduled task. Be very careful
as to write valid Javascript code since invalid code can break the tracker.

### Other plugins

Plugins can make use of the `CustomTrackerJs.getTrackerJsAdditions` event to register Javascript code to add to
the tracker.

For example this will add a `console.log("Hello world!");` line to the tracker:

```php
class MyPlugin extends \\Piwik\\Plugin
{
    public function getListHooksRegistered()
    {
        return array(
            \'CustomTrackerJs.getTrackerJsAdditions\' => \'getTrackerJsAdditions\',
        );
    }

    public function getTrackerJsAdditions(&$code)
    {
        $code .= PHP_EOL . \'console.log("Hello world!");\';
    }
}
```

## Description

This is a plugin for the Open Source Web Analytics platform Piwik. If enabled, it will add a new widget that you can add to your dashboard.

The widget will show the top performing pages of a site that auto-refreshes every x seconds. It shows the number of actions and the title of the page. It is auto-sorting the entries.

**This plugin should run fine with installations with up to 100.000 page impressions per day. If you run a very large piwik installation and have performance issues with this plugin, please contact me - there is a solution for this. I have it up and running in an installation with more than 10 million visits per day.**

(Tested with piwik 2.8.3, but supposed to run with older versions)
